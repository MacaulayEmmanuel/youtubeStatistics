# YouTube Statistics
This project uses SQL to analyze a dataset containing information about YouTube videos and comments. The dataset is provided by Kaggle and includes data on almost 2,000 videos and comments, such as the number of views, likes, and keywords.

# Getting Started
To get started with this project, you'll need to download the dataset from Kaggle and set up a SQL database. You can use a tool like MySQL or SQLite to create the database and import the data from the CSV files.

# Usage
Once you have the dataset loaded into your SQL database, you can use SQL queries to analyze the data and answer questions such as:

- What are the most commented-upon videos? Or the most liked?
- How many total views does each category have? How many likes?
- What are the most-liked comments?
- What is the ratio of views/likes per video? Per each category?
- What is the average sentiment score in each keyword category?
- How many times do company names (i.e., Apple or Samsung) appear in each keyword category?

You can run these queries in a SQL client or IDE such as MySQL Workbench, DBeaver, or SQLiteStudio. You can also use programming languages such as Python or R to execute SQL queries and generate visualizations of the results.

# Contributing
Contributions to this project are welcome! If you find any issues with the dataset or have suggestions for additional queries to run, please open an issue or submit a pull request.
